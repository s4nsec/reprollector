# Reprollector

Reprollector is a simple Rust command-line tool that recursively scans a specified
directory for reproducer files generated by syzkaller, categorizes them based
on their contents, and writes the results to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (stable version)
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reprollector.git
cd reprollector
cargo build --release
```

## Usage
```bash
cargo run -- -f /path/to/scan
```

The output by default is written to a folder named `reprollector_out`.

## Example Output
After running the tool, you might end up with a directory structure like this:
```
./reprollector_out/
└── 1684532585000/
    └── output.csv
```
